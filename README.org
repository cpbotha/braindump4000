#+TITLE: braindump4000: heavily modified jethrokuan braindump

Convert your nested org mode database with broken links into a Hugo website.

In addition to nesting and broken links, braindump4000 also deals with it if
you are already using Hugo to publish parts of your org mode database.

Find the original braindump at https://github.com/jethrokuan/braindump

You could also use org-publish, but on my 1000+ file database, that takes
forever, even when most of the files don't have to be republished.

* Quickstart

Let's say the root directory containing your nested org-mode database is
=~/notes/pkb4000= and you want a Hugo version in =~/notes/web-pkb4000= then you
could do the following:

** Create the hugo website

#+begin_src shell
  cd ~/notes
  hugo new site web-pkb4000
#+end_src

Install jethrokuan's [[https://github.com/jethrokuan/cortex][cortex]] theme:

#+begin_src shell
  cd ~/notes/web-pkb4000/themes
  git clone https://github.com/jethrokuan/cortex.git
#+end_src

Install his [[https://github.com/jethrokuan/braindump/blob/master/config.toml][config.toml]] at the top-level.

Add the root level of the config, add:

#+begin_src yaml
refLinksErrorLevel = "WARNING"
#+end_src

** Add two important pages

Create =web-pkb4000/content/_index.md= for the front page:

#+begin_src markdown
Well hello!

See the [index](posts).
#+end_src

Very importantly, create an empty =web-pkb4000/search/_index.md= just so that your search works.

** Build your site with braindump4000

#+begin_src shell
  # I usually clone braindump4000 inside my notes database pkb4000
  cd notes/pkb4000
  git clone https://github.com/cpbotha/braindump4000.git
  # this will build the site in ../../web-pkb4000
  cd notes/pkb4000/braindump4000
  python3 build.py
#+end_src

The instructions above are just following my example.

However, as long as you configure ~org_dir~ and ~hugo_dir~ correctly in =build.py=,
everything should work for different directory setups.

* Obligatory screenshot(s)

In the screenshot below, I started with the Apple WatchOS 9 sleep tracking
video note, from there the Sleep backlinks page, then the Seven and a Half
Lessons about the Brain book notes and finally my Books backlinks.
