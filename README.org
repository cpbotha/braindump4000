#+TITLE: braindump4000: heavily modified jethrokuan braindump

Convert your nested org mode database with broken links into a Hugo website.

In addition to nesting and broken links, braindump4000 also deals with it if
you are already using Hugo to publish parts of your org mode database.

Find the original braindump at https://github.com/jethrokuan/braindump

You could also use org-publish, but on my 1000+ file database, that takes
forever, even when most of the files don't have to be republished.

P.S. This tool is now also able to munge that Hugo-destined output for
Obsidian, so that you are able to access your org-mode database using the
Obsidian mobile app.

* Quickstart

Let's say the root directory containing your nested org-mode database is
=~/notes/pkb4000= and you want a Hugo version in =~/notes/web-pkb4000= then you
could do the following:

** Create the hugo website

#+begin_src shell
  cd ~/notes
  hugo new site web-pkb4000
#+end_src

Install jethrokuan's [[https://github.com/jethrokuan/cortex][cortex]] theme:

#+begin_src shell
  cd ~/notes/web-pkb4000/themes
  git clone https://github.com/jethrokuan/cortex.git
#+end_src

Install his [[https://github.com/jethrokuan/braindump/blob/master/config.toml][config.toml]] at the top-level.

Add the root level of the config, add:

#+begin_src yaml
refLinksErrorLevel = "WARNING"
#+end_src

** Add two important pages

Create =web-pkb4000/content/_index.md= for the front page:

#+begin_src markdown
Well hello!

See the [index](posts).
#+end_src

Very importantly, create an empty =web-pkb4000/search/_index.md= just so that your search works.

** Build your site with braindump4000

#+begin_src shell
  # I usually clone braindump4000 inside my notes database pkb4000
  cd notes/pkb4000
  git clone https://github.com/cpbotha/braindump4000.git
  cd notes/pkb4000/braindump4000
  # note that the destination directory is the desired Hugo section within "content"
  # for the cortex theme, this must be "posts"
  python3 build.py ~/notes/pkb4000 ~/notes/web-pkb4000/content/posts
#+end_src

The instructions above are just following my example.

However, as long as you specify your input and output directories correctly,
everything should work for different setups.

* Obsidian support

braindump4000 is also able to transform your org-mode database into an Obsidian vault.

This is a bit of a hack, but it does yield an Obsidian vault which is quite
usable, including image attachments, backlinks and so on.

This howto is simpler, because we don't need the whole Hugo site, only
something that looks like an Obsidian vault:

#+begin_src shell
  # I usually clone braindump4000 inside my notes database pkb4000
  cd notes/pkb4000
  git clone https://github.com/cpbotha/braindump4000.git
  cd notes/pkb4000/braindump4000
  python3 build.py --obsidian ~/notes/pkb4000 ~/notes/obs-pkb4000/content/posts
#+end_src

After this, you can open =~/notes/obs-pkb4000/= as an Obsidian vault.

The markdown in =content/posts/= has been massaged (see [[file:./obs_postproc.py][obs_postproc.py]] for
details) to support Obsidian's particular expectations, and images generally
end up in =static/ox-hugo=.

Personally, I use [[https://syncthing.net/][syncthing]] and [[https://www.mobiussync.com/][MÃ¶bius Sync]] to push the converted vault into
Obsidian's sandbox on my iPhone in order to get mobile access to my Org mode
database.

Note: On the mobile app, remember to activate =Settings - Editor - Display -
Srict line breaks= as the ox-hugo / markdown generally does add single line
breaks inside paragraphs.

* Obligatory screenshot(s)

In the screenshot below, I started with the Apple WatchOS 9 sleep tracking
video note, from there the Sleep backlinks page, then the Seven and a Half
Lessons about the Brain book notes and finally my Books backlinks.

My braindump site is being served using [[https://github.com/PierreZ/goStatic][goStatic,]] tightly bound to a private
[[https://tailscale.com/][tailnet]] IP.
